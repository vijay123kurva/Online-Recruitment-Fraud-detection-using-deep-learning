# Online Recruitment Fraud Detection using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to tackle the growing issue of **fraudulent job postings** on online platforms by developing an intelligent system that uses **Deep Learning** to detect scams. The system evaluates both the **textual content** (job title, description) and **visual elements** (such as fake logos or branding) to classify job advertisements as **genuine or fraudulent**.

The goal is to build a **user-friendly, scalable, and accurate** application that enhances the security of job seekers and recruitment platforms alike.
